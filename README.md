# NeverwinterNights-EE Dedicated Server in Docker optimized for Unraid
This Docker will download and install Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition and run it (by default this container has a MariaDB and Redis Server integrated).

**First Start:** Enter the Module name to load in the variable down below (without the .mod extension) start the container and wait for it until the log displays the message that the modules folder is empty, stop the container and place your mod file in the folder (.../Neverwinter Nights/modules) and restart the container (You can also place a mod file from your local installed game into the server eg.: .../Neverwinter Nights/data/mod/Contest of Champions 0492).

**ATTENTION:** First Startup can take very long since it downloads the gameserver files!

**Update Notice:** Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available.

**CONSOLE:** To connect to the console open up the terminal on the host machine and type in: 'docker exec -u nwnee -ti NAMEOFYOURCONTAINER screen -xS nwnee' (without quotes) to exit the screen session press CTRL+A and then CTRL+D or simply close the terminal window in the first place.
